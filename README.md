Project Description

Camp Gila Breath has a variety of staff roles, including the Director, a senior wrangler and two assistants, a roping instructor, a nurse, two hiking leaders, a rifle/archery instructor, three cooks, a passel of maintenance/cleaning workers, a song leader, and a registration clerk. The registration clerk is a member of the Director’s family—friendly and dependable, but not sophisticated in the use of computer applications. 

For now, the only purpose of the software is to support the work of the registration clerk: handling applications to camp, payments, mailing of notices of acceptance and arrival instruction packets, check-in of campers, and assignment of campers to bunkhouses and “tribes.” The director has chosen to defer for now any elaboration of the software, connection to the Internet, or interconnection with other applications. 

Camp Gila Breath offers three two-week camps every summer (weeks 2-3 in June, weeks 2-3 in July, and weeks 2-3 in August). Campers apply to attend any one of these in a given year. 

Applications and payments must be received two months prior to the start of camp, but no earlier than eight months before the start of camp, along with a check for $1,000. Upon receipt of application, clearing of the check, and verification that the prospective camper’s age is 9-18 (inclusive), a notice of acceptance and a packet of arrival instructions are mailed to him/her. (The date of this mailing is used in determining possible refunds—see below.) Each camp has a limit of 36 girls and 36 boys. Applications are accepted until this limit has been reached. 

Upon arrival of the camper, the registration clerk checks him/her in and verifies required forms from the arrival packet (medical, legal, emergency contact…) and required equipment (riding helmet, boots, sleeping bag, water bottle, sun screen, bug spray…). If required forms are missing, the camper’s parent/guardian must complete them; if required equipment is missing, the parent/guardian must rent/buy them from the camp store. 

Following check-in, the registration clerk assigns each camper to a bunkhouse and a “tribe.” There are three bunkhouses for girls and three for boys. Each bunkhouse can accommodate twelve occupants. It is common for siblings and/or friends come to camp together. These campers may request to be assigned to the same bunkhouse and/or tribe (or different ones). 

If a request for cancellation and refund is received, the registration clerk must process it. Cancellation of enrollment and refund of payment is allowed as follows: 90% within 3 weeks of mailing of notice of acceptance and arrival instructions; 45% within 6 weeks of mailing; 0% after this. 

Assignment of campers to bunkhouses should respect requests to keep together (or apart) family members or friends—there is a form in the arrival packet for this. The assignment process should also assign every girl to a girls’ bunkhouse and every boy to a boys’ bunkhouse. Other than this, the assignment process should attempt to balance ages and number of campers within each bunkhouse. Each girls’ bunkhouse should have about the same number of girls in it and should have about the same distribution of ages of girls in it. (Distribute the 18-year olds evenly across bunkhouse, the 17-year olds, the 16-year-olds, and so on.) The same kind of thing is true for boys’ bunkhouse. 

Assignment of campers to “tribes” should follow similar rules regarding family/friend requests, ages, and number of campers. (Tribes are groups of campers who work together on various projects and contests during the camp.) Members of tribes don’t have to be in the same bunkhouses; in fact they can’t be, since girls and boys are assigned to every tribe. Assignment should keep the ratio of girls to boys about the same across tribes, as well as balancing number of campers and their ages. 

There is no Internet or cell phone service at the camp’s location. (It is in the mountains about 100 miles from anywhere.) In fact, campers are not allowed to have any electronic devices while at the camp. The software for this project will—for now—be implemented on a stand-alone, single-workstation system. Neither multi-user nor network capabilities are required.
